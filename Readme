Setup

- npm run prepare
- cd ./client && npm run install
- cd ../server && npm run install
- Rename .template.env in both client and server to just .env and populate values. (the MONGO_URI env works already if running a local mongodb instance on your machine, and you want to connect to that rather than a remote, or containerized instance)
- Add the GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI to your approved URI's in Google Cloud.

To start project: npm run start

Every commit runs lint via husky
